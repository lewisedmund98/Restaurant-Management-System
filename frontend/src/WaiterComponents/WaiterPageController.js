/**
 * The waiter page controller is the component which deals with polling the API requests.
 * There are several requests it needs to make. 
 * 
 * The first of which is the unconfirmed orders.
 * 
 * The next is the To be delivered
 * 
 * The next are the 24 hour waiting period
 * 
 * The data from these are passed to the WaiterPageWrapper which deals with mapping the data from
 * the requests to the View elements. 
 * 
 * Note: For now this will not have requests done, but I will mimic this statically in the card wrapper
