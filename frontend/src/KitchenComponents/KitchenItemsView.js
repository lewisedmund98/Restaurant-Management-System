/**
 * The order list view is for the waiter page. It shows the orders in a neat table with
 * the information loaded into it.
 *
 * This will take a boolean as a prop, the boolean represents whether or not the order
 * is unconfirmed or to be delivered. In the case of an unconfirmed order the program will
 * display the confirm button with the action for the confirm being an API call to confirm.
 *
 * The second of which is representing the to be delivered in which case a button to set the state to "delivered"
 * these will both send different api POST calls to the backend where they handle the removal. All We need to do
 * is display
