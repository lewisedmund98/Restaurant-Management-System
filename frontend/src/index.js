/**
 * The class which is loaded first by react and will be used to put together everything. For now, this class is used
 * to render some of the components while the rest is made to test those components. 
 * 
 * The react router is a library in react which allows us to choose what page to display dependant on what
 * is in the URL at the given time. It allows us to do this by passing a path and the component to render.
 * 
 * THE STRUCTURE THAT IS USES IS AS FOLLOWS: The router takes a path and renders either a customer or a staff 
 * component. These components then produce their own "container" div which is added into the root div in the render here
 * 
 * If you want to:
 * 
 * - Add a new path : Copy the route tag with the path and the react component page you want to render
 *
