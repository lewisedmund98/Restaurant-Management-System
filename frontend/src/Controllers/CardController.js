/**
 * The Card Controller class is a class which is made to deal with the data that is going to be used in the
 * menu cards. This makes the API call and then stores the data in a state. This state propogates through
 * the program. This means that the properties of CardWrapper and MenuCard update when this updates.
 * 
 * This decouples the CardController from the Card wrapper.
 * 
 * The CardController calls the TabWrapper and passes in a JSON object array as properties. The logic
 * for how that is handled and rendered is in the TabWrapper class which takes the list and splits it into menu items
 * 
 * The controller can be made better by using a thread which updates the API call if the menu changes all
 * of a sudden.
 * 
 * CURRENT HIERACHY: CardController -> TabWrapper (Splits into 4 TYPES) -> CardWrapper (Makes 4 of these) -> 
 * MenuCard (Takes the items and displays) -> InfoModal (Event from MenuCard)
 * 
 * Note: Fetch is an asynchronous call so state must be used and may take a while to update a user PC if it's slow.
